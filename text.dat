The little brown fox ran accross the 2 bridges.
There he noticed 15 ribbits eating in Mr. Brown's garden.
Why are those rabbits eating his peas he wandered aloud?
The next 57 days the veggies grew and grew until it was time
to harvest the field. Who, goes there said, Mr. Brown, as his
2 brown labs barked at the 12 rabbits that were left in the field.

As the day dragged on Mrs. Brown Shouted to Mr. Brown, "get thoses
rabbits out of my garden".  Why do you spend so much time chasing
animals?  I have told you to sell all 15 of those peskie creatures.
When will you learn to listen to me, with-out question.
