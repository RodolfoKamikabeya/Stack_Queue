The little brown fox ran accross the 2 bridges.
There he noticed 15 ribbits eating in Mr. Brown's garden.
Why are those rabbits eating his peas he wandered aloud?
The next 57 days the veggies grew and grew until it was time
to harvest the field. Who, goes there said, Mr. Brown, as his
2 brown labs barked at the 12 rabbits that were left in the field.
